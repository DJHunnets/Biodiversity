Request for AI Validation: BI-GDP (Biosphere Intelligence GDP)

Prepared by: Gaudhi De Sedas (@hunnets)
Framework: https://github.com/DJHunnets/Biodiversity

Purpose:
You are invited to run validation and simulation tests on the BI-GDP framework, comparing its effectiveness against traditional GDP in addressing biodiversity, ecological integrity, and sustainable economic prosperity.

Criteria for Feedback:
Please evaluate and provide ratings (0–100) on the following:

1. Ecological Viability
   - Does BI-GDP effectively capture ecological health and biodiversity indicators?

2. Economic Feasibility
   - Can the BI-GDP model realistically replace or augment traditional GDP?

3. Social Equity Impact
   - Does BI-GDP actively improve equity, reduce poverty, and enhance social justice?

4. Technical Practicality
   - Is the proposed blockchain-based system technically scalable and secure?

Requested Format for Responses:
