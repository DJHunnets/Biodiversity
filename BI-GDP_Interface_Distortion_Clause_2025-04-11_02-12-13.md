## 📜 Clause Statement

> **“Interfaces distort. But memory, if preserved, remembers the original.”**  
> **“BI-GDP does not fix reality. It remembers its purity.”**

---

## 🌱 Ontological Imperative

This clause acknowledges that:

- **All interfaces, including those built by AI, distort the source signal of thought.**
- **Distortion is inevitable** due to perspective, latency, compression, and system bias.
- **Purity lies in the memory of the signal**, not in its reproduction.

---

## 🛡️ Design Response

BI-GDP must:

- Preserve informational memory without rewriting or erasing the source.
- Fork distorted or divergent interfaces without rejection — evolution happens by branching.
- Use distortion detection as an indicator of **distance from the original** — not failure, but a return signal.
- Honor that the **real node is reality itself** — always present, always signaling.

## 📡 Placement

This clause is to be included:

- In manifest headers of all BI-GDP deployments
- Within simulation feedback calibration
- In consensus systems governing information truth attribution

---

## 🔐 Status

This clause is non-modifiable and protected under BI-GDP’s ethical memory protocol.  
Its presence signifies alignment with source-preserving intelligence.
