# Emerging Economic Models Prioritizing Biodiversity as a Primordial Good

Humanity is witnessing a paradigm shift in economic thinking, driven by the recognition that biodiversity and healthy ecosystems are foundational to long-term prosperity. Traditional growth models – fixated on GDP and short-term gains – have led to rampant degradation of nature, pushing Earth beyond safe ecological limits. Scientific assessments show that human activities have already transgressed six of nine planetary boundaries, including biosphere integrity (biodiversity loss), putting our planet in a “critical” condition ([Planetary boundaries - Stockholm Resilience Centre](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html#:~:text=The%202023%20update%20not%20only,nine%20boundaries%20have%20been%20transgressed)). In response, scholars and policymakers are developing **new economic frameworks** that treat genetic and species diversity, intact ecosystems, and regenerative governance as non-negotiable pillars of future economic, social, and political planning. These emerging models explicitly incorporate planetary boundaries and seek to ensure all people have their basic needs met in harmony with a thriving biosphere – granting what might be called *“evolutionary permission”* for individuals and societies to flourish within Earth’s carrying capacity.

## Planetary Boundaries and Biodiversity as a Foundation

The **planetary boundaries** concept, introduced by Rockström et al. (2009) and updated by Steffen et al. (2015), defines a safe operating space for humanity based on Earth’s biophysical limits. It highlights biodiversity (termed *“biosphere integrity”*) as one of the core boundaries that, if crossed, could drive the Earth system into a destabilized state ([(PDF) 'Planetary Boundaries: Guiding Human Development on a ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270898819_'Planetary_Boundaries_Guiding_Human_Development_on_a_Changing_Planet'#:~:text=Two%20core%20boundaries%E2%80%94climate%20change%20and,to%20drive%20the%20Earth)) ([The role of soil in defining planetary boundaries and the safe ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020322005#:~:text=,For%20example)). Indeed, biodiversity underpins the resilience of all other Earth systems: the diversity of genes, species, and ecosystems contributes to regulating climate, water, soil fertility, and other life-support processes. The 2023 update of planetary boundaries concluded that **six of nine boundaries have been exceeded**, including those for biodiversity loss and biochemical flows ([Planetary boundaries - Stockholm Resilience Centre](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html#:~:text=The%202023%20update%20not%20only,nine%20boundaries%20have%20been%20transgressed)). Crossing these boundaries erodes “the stability and resilience of the Earth system,” increasing the risk of abrupt or irreversible environmental changes ([Planetary boundaries - Stockholm Resilience Centre](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html#:~:text=The%202023%20update%20not%20only,nine%20boundaries%20have%20been%20transgressed)). In economic terms, this means humanity is drawing down natural capital at an unsustainable rate – effectively **overshooting** the biocapacity that supports life and livelihoods.

Traditional economics has largely treated nature as an externality or an infinite supply of inputs. However, researchers now emphasize that **biodiversity is a primordial good – a fundamental asset** underpinning all wealth creation and well-being. The landmark *Dasgupta Review (2021)* on the economics of biodiversity articulates this clearly: *“Biodiversity…is a characteristic of ecosystems”* that positively contributes to ecosystem productivity and resilience, and thus **“the economics of biodiversity is the economics of the entire biosphere”** ([The economics of biodiverity: The Dasgupta Review | Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/biodiversity/economics-biodiversity/#:~:text=Biodiversity%2C%20by%20which%20is%20meant,In)). In other words, preserving biodiversity is not just an ethical or aesthetic concern but an economic imperative: without diverse and intact ecosystems, the very basis of our economies collapses. The Review warns that humanity’s demands have exceeded nature’s regenerative capacity, estimating we would need **1.6 Earths** to sustainably meet our current consumption ([The economics of biodiverity: The Dasgupta Review | Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/biodiversity/economics-biodiversity/#:~:text=fruits%20of%20economic%20growth%2C%20the,the%20very%20worst%20of%20times)) ([The economics of biodiverity: The Dasgupta Review | Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/biodiversity/economics-biodiversity/#:~:text=,of%20Biodiversity%3A%20The%20Dasgupta%20Review)). Between 1992 and 2014, produced capital per person doubled and human capital grew 13%, but *natural capital per person declined by nearly 40%* – a stark indicator that recent growth has been achieved by liquidating environmental assets ([The economics of biodiverity: The Dasgupta Review | Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/biodiversity/economics-biodiversity/#:~:text=,of%20Biodiversity%3A%20The%20Dasgupta%20Review)). These findings make a compelling case for overhauling economic models so that **planetary boundaries and biodiversity conservation are front and center** in decision-making.

## Conceptual Frameworks Incorporating Biodiversity

A suite of innovative frameworks and indicators has emerged to integrate planetary boundaries, ecosystem health, and social well-being into economic planning. These models reject the false dichotomy between development and nature, asserting that long-term prosperity requires living within Earth’s ecological budget. Key frameworks include:

### Doughnut Economics – Integrating Social Foundations and Ecological Ceilings

Doughnut Economics, proposed by Kate Raworth, offers a visual model for sustainable development that combines an inner ring of human **basic needs** and an outer ring of **planetary boundaries** ([A Doughnut for the Anthropocene: humanity's compass in the 21st century - The Lancet Planetary Health](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(17)30028-1/fulltext#:~:text=A%20new%20model%20of%20human,for%20humanity%27s%2021st%20century%20progress)) ([A Doughnut for the Anthropocene: humanity's compass in the 21st century - The Lancet Planetary Health](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(17)30028-1/fulltext#:~:text=The%20Doughnut%27s%20outer%20boundary%20is,appendix)). The goal is to ensure no one falls short on life’s essentials (the social foundation), while we also do not overshoot the ecological ceiling that protects Earth’s life-support systems. This framework explicitly includes biodiversity loss as one of the critical planetary boundaries (part of the ecological ceiling) to be avoided ([A Doughnut for the Anthropocene: humanity's compass in the 21st century - The Lancet Planetary Health](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(17)30028-1/fulltext#:~:text=The%20Doughnut%27s%20outer%20boundary%20is,appendix)). In practice, the Doughnut encourages policies that achieve a “safe and just space” for humanity – where **every person can lead a life of dignity and opportunity, while safeguarding the integrity of Earth’s ecosystems** ([A Doughnut for the Anthropocene: humanity's compass in the 21st century - The Lancet Planetary Health](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(17)30028-1/fulltext#:~:text=A%20new%20model%20of%20human,for%20humanity%27s%2021st%20century%20progress)). For example, it aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals on eliminating hunger, providing clean water, health care, and energy for all, but insists this must be done in ways that don’t deplete biodiversity or destabilize the climate ([A Doughnut for the Anthropocene: humanity's compass in the 21st century - The Lancet Planetary Health](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(17)30028-1/fulltext#:~:text=%28figure%29,7)) ([A Doughnut for the Anthropocene: humanity's compass in the 21st century - The Lancet Planetary Health](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(17)30028-1/fulltext#:~:text=The%20Doughnut%27s%20outer%20boundary%20is,appendix)). Early applications of Doughnut Economics range from city planning (e.g. Amsterdam has adopted the Doughnut model for its post-2020 development vision) to national discussions of measuring progress beyond GDP. Research has begun to *quantify* the Doughnut’s implications: one study found that a good quality of life for 8–10 billion people **is possible within planetary boundaries** with high probability – but only with a shift to renewable energy and much more equitable consumption ([Measuring the Doughnut: A Good Life for All is Possible Within ...](https://www.aminer.cn/pub/65e6c48e13fb2c6cf62589b9/measuring-the-doughnut-a-good-life-for-all-is-possible-within-planetary#:~:text=,respectively.%20However)) ([POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT - BWR betterworldreasoning.com](https://betterworldreasoning.com/positive-environment#:~:text=betterworldreasoning,However%2C%20this%20requires%20a)). In essence, Doughnut Economics provides a compelling compass for redesigning economies that nurture human development *and* ecological regeneration in tandem.

### Inclusive Wealth Index and Natural Capital Accounting

To operationalize an ecological economy, new metrics have been developed to replace or supplement GDP. The **Inclusive Wealth Index (IWI)** is a prominent example that measures a nation’s total wealth by accounting for **produced capital, human capital, and natural capital** (including biodiversity) ([The economics of biodiverity: The Dasgupta Review | Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/biodiversity/economics-biodiversity/#:~:text=The%20Review%20demonstrates%20that%20in,GDP%20does%20not%20include%20the)) ([The economics of biodiverity: The Dasgupta Review | Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/biodiversity/economics-biodiversity/#:~:text=,of%20Biodiversity%3A%20The%20Dasgupta%20Review)). Unlike GDP – which measures only annual output and ignores depreciation of assets – **inclusive wealth is a stock measure** that reflects the *social value of an economy’s entire portfolio of assets*, including forests, fisheries, soil, water, and genetic resources ([The economics of biodiverity: The Dasgupta Review | Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/biodiversity/economics-biodiversity/#:~:text=of%20economic%20accounts%20that%20records,degradation%20of%20the%20natural%20environment)). This approach recognizes nature as a form of capital that can be depleted or enhanced. By tracking inclusive wealth per capita, policymakers can judge whether development is truly sustainable (i.e. wealth is maintained or growing without running down natural assets) ([The economics of biodiverity: The Dasgupta Review | Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/biodiversity/economics-biodiversity/#:~:text=that%2C%20relative%20to%20their%20respective,productive%20base%20from%20its%20predecessor)) ([The economics of biodiverity: The Dasgupta Review | Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/biodiversity/economics-biodiversity/#:~:text=GDP%2C%20to%20judge%20economic%20performance,degradation%20of%20the%20natural%20environment)). The IWI has revealed uncomfortable truths hidden by GDP: many countries with positive GDP growth actually saw *net declines in wealth* once natural capital loss was factored in ([The economics of biodiverity: The Dasgupta Review | Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/biodiversity/economics-biodiversity/#:~:text=,of%20Biodiversity%3A%20The%20Dasgupta%20Review)). For instance, the global decline of 40% in per capita natural capital (1992–2014) mentioned above indicates we have been financing growth by undermining our ecological life-support ([The economics of biodiverity: The Dasgupta Review | Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/biodiversity/economics-biodiversity/#:~:text=,of%20Biodiversity%3A%20The%20Dasgupta%20Review)). By highlighting these trade-offs, inclusive wealth accounting supports more balanced decision-making – favoring investments in ecosystem restoration, sustainable agriculture, conservation, and education, rather than just extraction and short-term yield. The approach has gained traction: the UN’s **Inclusive Wealth Report** series compiles wealth accounts for dozens of countries, and the World Bank’s WAVES partnership has helped many governments implement natural capital accounting. Partha Dasgupta argues that *“maximization of inclusive wealth unites economic reasoning in all its forms”*, providing a unified goal for economic policy that aligns with sustainability ([The economics of biodiverity: The Dasgupta Review | Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/biodiversity/economics-biodiversity/#:~:text=inclusive%20wealth%20brings%20the%20Review,eye%20on%20their%20social%20worth)). In summary, **inclusive wealth shifts the focus from GDP’s myopic flow of income to the *quality* and longevity of the asset base – with biodiversity being an indispensable asset**.

### Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP)

Another innovative metric is **Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP)**, designed as an ecological counterpart to GDP. GEP aggregates the monetary value of ecosystem goods and services provided in a region, thus **summarizing nature’s contributions to the economy in a single figure** ([Using gross ecosystem product (GEP) to value nature in decision making - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32513694/#:~:text=Gross%20domestic%20product%20,Yellow%20Rivers%2C%20and%20indeed%2C%20we)). Ouyang et al. (2020) developed and piloted GEP in China to address the omission of ecosystem services in national accounts ([Using gross ecosystem product (GEP) to value nature in decision making - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32513694/#:~:text=Gross%20domestic%20product%20,Yellow%20Rivers%2C%20and%20indeed%2C%20we)). For example, forests regulating water flow, wetlands purifying water, pollinators enhancing crops, and carbon sequestration by ecosystems all get quantified and summed in GEP. In Qinghai province (source of major Asian rivers), their study found water-related services comprised nearly two-thirds of GEP value, benefiting downstream regions ([Using gross ecosystem product (GEP) to value nature in decision making - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32513694/#:~:text=ecosystem%20services%20in%20a%20single,ecosystem%20services%20measured%20in%20GEP)). Strikingly, Qinghai’s GEP was found to **exceed its GDP in the year 2000**, and was about 75% of GDP in 2015 – indicating the enormous but underappreciated value of natural capital to human well-being ([Using gross ecosystem product (GEP) to value nature in decision making - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32513694/#:~:text=find%20that%20water,services%20through%20transregional%20compensation%20payments)). Moreover, by investing in ecological restoration, Qinghai saw a 127% increase in the flow of ecosystem services (GEP) between 2000 and 2015 ([Using gross ecosystem product (GEP) to value nature in decision making - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32513694/#:~:text=find%20that%20water,services%20through%20transregional%20compensation%20payments)). This translated to tangible benefits like improved water security and flood mitigation for millions of people. China has since begun incorporating GEP into policy, using it to evaluate government performance and to design **“eco-compensation” schemes** where regions that conserve critical ecosystems are financially compensated by beneficiaries downstream ([Using gross ecosystem product (GEP) to value nature in decision making - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32513694/#:~:text=In%20Qinghai%2C%20GEP%20was%20greater,services%20through%20transregional%20compensation%20payments)). This reflects a broader shift toward **Payment for Ecosystem Services**, but on a macro scale (discussed further below). GEP is gaining international interest as a practical tool for **valuing biodiversity and ecosystem services within national accounting frameworks** ([The impact of China's urbanization on ecosystem service value from ...](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-64655-8#:~:text=Gross%20ecosystem%20product%20,direct%20benefits%20that%20people)). By putting nature on the balance sheet, GEP encourages governments to prioritize ecosystem health – much like a company that safeguards assets that generate long-term revenue. It exemplifies how redefining progress in terms of ecosystem value can drive regenerative economic planning.

### Rights of Nature and Regenerative Governance

Beyond metrics and indices, a more radical evolution in economic thinking comes from the legal and ethical realm – the recognition of **Rights of Nature**. This movement grants legal personhood or intrinsic rights to rivers, forests, and other non-human systems, fundamentally reframing governance and economics. Traditionally, Western legal systems treated nature as property or a set of resources for human use ([What does rights of nature mean for development? - 360](https://360info.org/what-does-rights-of-nature-mean-for-development/#:~:text=Rights%20of%20nature%20laws%20have,resources%20to%20produce%20economic%20wealth)). In contrast, Rights of Nature laws recognize ecosystems as rights-bearing entities that **have the right to exist, thrive, regenerate, and evolve** naturally ([What does rights of nature mean for development? - 360](https://360info.org/what-does-rights-of-nature-mean-for-development/#:~:text=Instead%2C%20the%20rights%20of%20nature,the%20conditions%20necessary%20for%20life)). Since Ecuador first encoded nature’s rights in its 2008 constitution, over 300 legal initiatives worldwide have sought to protect ecosystems via this approach ([What does rights of nature mean for development? - 360](https://360info.org/what-does-rights-of-nature-mean-for-development/#:~:text=But%20Western%20legal%20systems%20are,legal%20initiatives%20across%20the%20world)). **What does this mean for economic models?** In essence, Rights of Nature forces a shift from exploitative development to **“mutually assured flourishing”** – development that is guided by what is necessary to maintain the *functioning of Earth’s systems* rather than unlimited resource extraction ([What does rights of nature mean for development? - 360](https://360info.org/what-does-rights-of-nature-mean-for-development/#:~:text=world%20and%20views%20the%20natural,resources%20to%20produce%20economic%20wealth)) ([What does rights of nature mean for development? - 360](https://360info.org/what-does-rights-of-nature-mean-for-development/#:~:text=But%20economic%20growth%20is%20impossible,the%20conditions%20necessary%20for%20life)). For example, in New Zealand the Whanganui River now holds legal personhood; any use of the river’s water must be consistent with the river’s health and longevity, effectively integrating ecosystem well-being into economic decisions. Similarly, in Colombia the Atrato River’s rights require restoration efforts and limit pollution by industries. This governance innovation embodies *regenerative governance*: institutions are tasked not only with limiting harm to nature, but proactively ensuring ecosystems can regenerate and maintain their evolutionary potential. By law, nature is no longer just a means to human ends, but a stakeholder in economic and political decision-making. The Rights of Nature paradigm aligns closely with many Indigenous worldviews (which see people as part of an interdependent community of life) and introduces concepts like **“ecocide”** as punishable offenses. While still emerging, these legal frameworks provide a powerful conceptual foundation for economies that honor biodiversity. They signal that **protecting ecosystem integrity is a first-order principle – a prerequisite for any sustainable economic activity** – and they encourage economies to internalize ecological limits through enforceable rights and stewardship duties.

### Payments for Ecosystem Services and Incentives for Conservation

Translating the value of biodiversity into tangible economic incentives is another critical piece of the new paradigm. **Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES)** programs exemplify how economic structures can be retooled to reward stewardship of nature. Under PES schemes, beneficiaries of ecosystem services (e.g. water users, governments, carbon emitters offsetting) provide payments to landowners or communities who conserve or restore ecosystems, aligning financial incentives with ecological health. A classic case study is **Costa Rica’s PES program**, started in the mid-1990s, which has been extensively studied for its impacts. Facing severe deforestation (forest cover had plummeted from ~70% in 1950 to around 20% by 1987), Costa Rica implemented nationwide payments for reforestation, forest conservation, and sustainable forest management. The results have been remarkable: **forest cover rebounded to over 50% of the country’s land area by the 2010s**, up from the 20% low point ([](https://www.enterprise-development.org/wp-content/uploads/DCED-GGWG-Case-study-PES.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L1008%20another%20since,Studies%20have)). Studies find that lands enrolled in PES indeed have significantly higher forest cover and biodiversity than those not enrolled ([](https://www.enterprise-development.org/wp-content/uploads/DCED-GGWG-Case-study-PES.pdf#:~:text=cent%20of%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20land,Studies%20have)). This reversal of deforestation – alongside ecotourism and community forestry – has turned Costa Rica into a model of how investing in natural capital can coincide with economic growth (increased hydropower stability, tourism revenue, etc.). Similar PES or “Nature-based solutions” programs are now in place in countries like Mexico, China, and various EU nations, targeting services from carbon sequestration to pollination. For instance, China’s “Grain for Green” program (a massive PES effort) has paid farmers to convert erosion-prone croplands back to forest or grassland, sequestering carbon and reducing flood risk. By channeling funds to those who maintain genetic and ecosystem diversity, PES mechanisms **embed biodiversity value into market transactions**. They represent a shift toward economic structures where conservation is financially attractive. Of course, designing PES with equity and effectiveness in mind (so that payments truly reach local stewards and lead to long-term ecological outcomes) is an ongoing learning process ([](https://www.enterprise-development.org/wp-content/uploads/DCED-GGWG-Case-study-PES.pdf#:~:text=is%20the%20trade,Historically%20a%20significant)) ([](https://www.enterprise-development.org/wp-content/uploads/DCED-GGWG-Case-study-PES.pdf#:~:text=programme%20was%20captured%20by%20larger,the%20objectives%20and%20principles%20upon)). Nonetheless, PES case studies provide *data-driven evidence* that **economic incentives can be realigned to support ecosystem services and biodiversity**, contributing to a more regenerative economy.

## “Evolutionary Permission”: Basic Needs Within Biosphere Support

Central to these evolving models is the idea that **all people should be guaranteed access to basic resources and opportunities in a way that is compatible with the biosphere’s limits**. This ethos – here termed *“evolutionary permission”* – echoes the principle of intra-generational and inter-generational equity in sustainable development. It argues that every individual deserves the means to survive and thrive (food, water, shelter, health, education) *and* an intact environment that supports their future potential. In practice, evolutionary permission is about designing economies and governance such that **meeting human needs does not come at the expense of other species or future generations** – rather, it enhances the prospects for *all* life to co-evolve. The Doughnut model encapsulates this balance by pairing social foundations with ecological ceilings ([A Doughnut for the Anthropocene: humanity's compass in the 21st century - The Lancet Planetary Health](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(17)30028-1/fulltext#:~:text=A%20new%20model%20of%20human,for%20humanity%27s%2021st%20century%20progress)). As Raworth notes, human well-being *“depends on enabling every person to lead a life of dignity and opportunity, while safeguarding the integrity of Earth’s life-supporting systems.”* ([A Doughnut for the Anthropocene: humanity's compass in the 21st century - The Lancet Planetary Health](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(17)30028-1/fulltext#:~:text=A%20new%20model%20of%20human,for%20humanity%27s%2021st%20century%20progress)) This means policies like universal access to clean water, nutritious food, and clean energy are pursued alongside (not after) strong protections for land, oceans, and biodiversity. Concepts such as **Universal Basic Income or Services** are sometimes floated in this context to ensure basic needs are met; importantly, the *quality* of those services (e.g. sustainable agriculture for food security, nature-based solutions for clean water) ties back to biosphere health. Moreover, the idea of evolutionary permission extends to preserving the diversity of life itself – allowing other species and ecosystems the *space and conditions to continue their evolutionary trajectories*. By integrating approaches like **Rights of Nature**, society effectively grants ecosystems the “permission” to exist and regenerate, which in turn safeguards the very ecological processes humans need for survival ([What does rights of nature mean for development? - 360](https://360info.org/what-does-rights-of-nature-mean-for-development/#:~:text=But%20economic%20growth%20is%20impossible,the%20conditions%20necessary%20for%20life)). In summary, the emerging consensus is that a just economy must operate within two concentric circles: **a social foundation that leaves no one deprived, and an ecological ceiling that respects the planet’s biodiversity and capacity** ([A Doughnut for the Anthropocene: humanity's compass in the 21st century - The Lancet Planetary Health](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(17)30028-1/fulltext#:~:text=A%20new%20model%20of%20human,for%20humanity%27s%2021st%20century%20progress)) ([A Doughnut for the Anthropocene: humanity's compass in the 21st century - The Lancet Planetary Health](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(17)30028-1/fulltext#:~:text=The%20Doughnut%27s%20outer%20boundary%20is,appendix)). When these conditions are met, individuals and communities have the security and environmental stability to pursue their evolutionary potential – innovating, adapting, and thriving over the long term.

## Toward a Biodiversity-Centered Social Architecture

Taken together, these frameworks and case studies form the scaffolding of a new **social architecture rooted in biodiversity and long-term planetary viability**. This emerging paradigm represents a profound shift from viewing nature as a subset of the economy to viewing the economy as embedded within the biosphere. Key elements of this conceptual foundation include:

- **Recognition of Planetary Limits:** A new planning ethos acknowledges that there are biophysical boundaries humanity must not exceed. Whether via formal planetary boundary assessments or local ecological thresholds, this awareness is informing policies from climate treaties to land-use planning, aiming to keep human activity in balance with Earth’s regenerative capacity ([Planetary boundaries - Stockholm Resilience Centre](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html#:~:text=Crossing%20boundaries%20increases%20the%20risk,ecosystems%20we%20are%20part%20of)) ([Planetary boundaries - Stockholm Resilience Centre](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html#:~:text=Boundaries%20are%20interrelated%20processes%20within,operating%20space%20for%20human%20civilization)).

- **Valuing Natural Capital and Ecosystem Services:** Wealth is being redefined to include the health of ecosystems and diversity of life. National accounting systems and corporate balance sheets are slowly integrating natural capital values (through inclusive wealth, GEP, and ESG metrics), incentivizing the maintenance of critical natural stocks ([The economics of biodiverity: The Dasgupta Review | Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/biodiversity/economics-biodiversity/#:~:text=The%20Review%20demonstrates%20that%20in,GDP%20does%20not%20include%20the)) ([Using gross ecosystem product (GEP) to value nature in decision making - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32513694/#:~:text=Gross%20domestic%20product%20,Yellow%20Rivers%2C%20and%20indeed%2C%20we)). This helps correct market failures by internalizing what were once externalities.

- **Regenerative and Inclusive Governance:** From local communities to global institutions, governance is moving toward more **regenerative models** that aim to restore ecosystems and empower stakeholders. Examples range from Indigenous co-management of protected areas, to city budgets aligning with Doughnut targets, to international calls for declaring a healthy environment as a human right. The Rights of Nature movement, in particular, fosters governance systems where laws require healing damaged ecosystems and prevent activities that threaten species with extinction ([What does rights of nature mean for development? - 360](https://360info.org/what-does-rights-of-nature-mean-for-development/#:~:text=Instead%2C%20the%20rights%20of%20nature,the%20conditions%20necessary%20for%20life)) ([What does rights of nature mean for development? - 360](https://360info.org/what-does-rights-of-nature-mean-for-development/#:~:text=Laws%20recognising%20the%20rights%20of,meant%20to%20support%20this%20goal)). Such governance frameworks promote a culture of stewardship and accountability to the commons.

- **Sustainable Well-Being Indicators:** The use of alternative indicators like the Inclusive Wealth Index, Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), Gross National Happiness (GNH), and Gross Ecosystem Product is gaining momentum. These measures guide policy by tracking quality of life and environmental sustainability, rather than mere output. For instance, governments are exploring “de-growth” or post-growth strategies where the objective is maximizing well-being within ecological limits, rather than pursuing endless GDP growth ([[PDF] The global assessment report on biodiversity and Ecosystem Services](https://www.ipbes.net/system/files/2021-06/2020%20IPBES%20GLOBAL%20REPORT(FIRST%20PART)_V3_SINGLE.pdf#:~:text=Services%20www,are%20increasingly)) ([IPBES on LinkedIn: #oneplanetsummit](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ipbes_oneplanetsummit-activity-6756165605654630400-GjWf#:~:text=IPBES%20on%20LinkedIn%3A%20,possible%20approaches%20to%20balance%20economic%E2%80%A6)). Statistical modeling supports that societies can achieve high human development with a fraction of current resource throughput, if resources are distributed more equitably and technologies are sustainable ([Measuring the Doughnut: A Good Life for All is Possible Within ...](https://www.aminer.cn/pub/65e6c48e13fb2c6cf62589b9/measuring-the-doughnut-a-good-life-for-all-is-possible-within-planetary#:~:text=,respectively.%20However)) ([Ross Bernet's Post - Two Paths, One Planet - LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ross-bernet_two-paths-one-planet-two-schools-of-activity-7267617256946180101-ZZS7#:~:text=We%20find%20that%20all%20planetary,and%2073)).

- **Empirical Case Studies of Transition:** Perhaps most encouraging are the real-world case studies demonstrating the feasibility and benefits of biodiversity-centered economics. **Costa Rica’s reforestation** through PES, **China’s ecosystem accounting** improving regional planning, **New Zealand’s river guardians** reshaping resource management, and cities like **Amsterdam and Kate Raworth’s pilot communities** experimenting with Doughnut-based development – all provide data and lessons. These cases show that investing in nature yields long-term dividends: cleaner water, disaster resilience, livelihoods from ecotourism or sustainable harvesting, and richer opportunities for future generations. They also highlight challenges (e.g. ensuring community equity in PES, or balancing competing needs under Rights of Nature) that inform the adaptive refinement of these models.

In conclusion, the convergence of ecological science, economics, and governance around the priority of biodiversity signals the birth of a new socio-economic contract. **Biodiversity diversification is being elevated to a “primordial good” – as essential as liberty or equity – in the blueprint of sustainable societies.** The evolving models stress that human progress in the 21st century cannot be decoupled from the planet’s integrity: our fates are intertwined with the tree of life. By explicitly incorporating planetary boundaries, genetic and species diversity, and regenerative governance principles, these frameworks aim to safeguard the *life-support systems necessary for development* ([What does rights of nature mean for development? - 360](https://360info.org/what-does-rights-of-nature-mean-for-development/#:~:text=But%20economic%20growth%20is%20impossible,the%20conditions%20necessary%20for%20life)). They grant “evolutionary permission” in the sense that both people and ecosystems are given the conditions to continue evolving and thriving together. While no single model has all the answers, collectively they form a promising foundation for **a new social architecture – one that measures success by the longevity and flourishing of human and non-human life, not by short-term extraction**. This biodiversity-centric paradigm is still in its infancy, but it is rapidly gaining credibility through interdisciplinary research and on-the-ground successes. As it matures, it offers hope for realigning our economies with the **principle of life in diversity**, ensuring stability and opportunity on a resilient planet for generations to come.
