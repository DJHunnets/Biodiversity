# Biosphere Blockchain Architecture: Data Flow and Governance

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture of the Biosphere Blockchainâ€”a decentralized system designed to ingest, validate, and integrate ecological data into the BI-GDP model. The structure ensures data integrity, traceability, and participatory governance.

## 1. Data Input Layer
- **Sources**: Satellite imagery, IoT sensors, citizen science platforms, national biodiversity inventories, academic datasets.
- **Standards**: Adheres to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).
- **Formats**: Accepts GeoJSON, CSV, JSON-LD, NetCDF, and standardized REST APIs.

## 2. Validation & Provenance Layer
- **Proof-of-Integrity Protocol**: AI consensus and human peer-validation confirm data accuracy.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automate data verification, timestamping, and source authentication.
- **Reputation System**: Tracks source credibility based on validation history.

## 3. Processing & Indexing Layer
- **Semantic Tagging**: Machine learning applies ecological taxonomies and geospatial classification.
- **Oracles**: Verified external data is aggregated via decentralized oracles.
- **Index Updates**: BI-GDP recalculations are scheduled and transparently recorded.

## 4. Storage Layer
- **Hybrid Storage**: Blockchain stores metadata and indices; IPFS/Arweave stores large or raw datasets.
- **Security**: Uses zero-knowledge proofs for privacy and cryptographic backups for redundancy.

## 5. Access & Governance Layer
- **Access**: Role-based controls via decentralized identities (DIDs).
- **DAO Governance**: A decentralized autonomous organization allows stakeholder voting on model parameters, data weights, and network policies.

## Use Case Integration
This architecture enables governments, researchers, and civil society to co-govern a trusted, dynamic indicator for ecological and economic resilience.

**Next Step:**
- Add this architecture to the GitHub repository as `/docs/blockchain-architecture.md`
- Link to governance proposals and technical specs for implementation.
- Embed a system diagram in the README or Wiki section.
