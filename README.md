# BI-GDP: Aligning Intelligence with Biodiversity

**Author:** Gaudhi De Sedas (@hunnets)

## Overview
This repository introduces the BI-GDP framework, a regenerative economic model that integrates ecological intelligence, biodiversity metrics, and decentralized governance mechanisms through a concept called BiosphereChain.

## Key Insights
- **Diversification is Intelligence:** Biodiversity represents a form of distributed planetary cognition.
- **GDP with Regeneration:** Growth must be measured by ecological renewal, not extraction.
- **Entropy-Based AI Alignment:** Environmental entropy must guide AI models, not just emissions.
- **Decentralized Ecology:** Ecosystem-inspired governance mirrors nature's fluid, non-hierarchical order.
- **Culture-Biology Nexus:** Preserving cultural diversity enhances biological resilience.

## Supporting Data
- 1 million species face extinction (UN IPBES, 2020).
- $44 trillion of GDP dependent on nature (WEF, 2023).
- Strong correlation between linguistic and biological diversity.
