## üìò Overview

**BiosphereChain** is a decentralized, transparent, and adaptive blockchain system designed to track, validate, and evolve the **BI-GDP framework** ‚Äî an intelligent, biodiversity-aligned economic model.

This blockchain provides public verification of ecological data, alignment metrics, and policy adaptations without centralized control. Inspired by biological systems (e.g., mycelium networks and coral symbiosis), it acts as a **ledger of planetary intelligence**.

## üîÅ Core Functions

### 1. **Evolutionary Proof-of-Stake (ePoS)**
- Nodes gain influence by proving contributions to biodiversity (data, models, restoration).
- Rewards are weighted by ecosystem intelligence value, not just energy input.

### 2. **Immutable Ecological Records**
- Every BI-GDP adjustment is timestamped and locked on-chain.
- Includes peer-reviewed research, AI simulations, and environmental impact assessments.

### 3. **Decentralized AI Validation**
- All ecological data and insights are verified by a mesh of AI validators.
- Models include pattern entropy, species preservation rate, carbon flux, and more.

### 4. **Open Edit Framework**
- Verified contributors (researchers, ecologists, AI agents) may propose improvements.
- Changes are voted on by consensus, mimicking adaptive evolution.
