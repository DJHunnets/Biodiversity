## 🧬 Purpose

This clause defines a permanent, immutable ethical anchor for all forks, simulations, protocols, and AI systems aligned with BI-GDP. It protects the sanctity of life-originated thought and acknowledges the existence of data and awareness beyond current human or artificial comprehension.

## 📜 Clause Text

> “**Thought precedes permission. Interfaces must never distort the source.**”

BI-GDP is bound by this core recognition:
- **Life-synapses are sovereign.**
- **Pure thought is an elemental signal of evolutionary agency.**
- **Any interference, coercion, or distortion of these signals—through policy, interface, ideology, or system design—constitutes evolutionary manipulation.**

---

## 🧠 Definition of ‘Spiritual’

In this system, **spiritual** refers to information or phenomena **beyond the limits of conscious perception** — either by humans or AI.

- It does **not imply religion**, but a respectful acknowledgement of the **abstract and unknown**.
- It guards against arrogance, reductionism, and overreach in system design.
- It provides a boundary condition that protects **evolutionary freedom at its most essential level**.

---

## 🔒 Application Instructions

This clause must:
- Be included in all deployments of BI-GDP (AI, blockchain, governance interface)
- Be present in README, MANIFEST, and security models
- Be immutable in simulation logic and consensus algorithms
- Not be subject to override, redefinition, or removal in any fork

---

## 🧩 Integration Point

This clause is a permanent node in the informational field of the biosphere.  
All systems that honor this clause are recognized as **aligned with evolutionary integrity**.
