# BiosphereChain GitHub Documentation

**Project Title:** BiosphereChain: A Blockchain for Biodiversity & Ecological Intelligence  
**Author:** Gaudhi De Sedas (@hunnets)  
**License:** MIT  
**Repository:** https://github.com/DJHunnets/Biodiversity

## 📘 Overview

**BiosphereChain** is an open-source blockchain framework that tracks and validates global economic alignment with ecological limits. It integrates biodiversity indicators and biosphere intelligence into an immutable ledger designed for global transparency, auditability, and sustainability-based governance.

## 🔍 Core Concepts

### BI-GDP (Biosphere Intelligence-GDP)
A recalibrated growth metric that prioritizes ecosystem health, biodiversity balance, and human well-being.

### Debt-to-Nature Ratio
Global debt relative to the value of ecosystem services. Should remain below 1.5:1.

### Blockchain Parameters
Each block in BiosphereChain contains:
- Ecological investment (% of GDP)
- CO₂ price per ton
- Resource extraction (% sustainable yield)
- Wealth concentration (top 1%)
- Corporate ecosystem impact score
- Timestamp & validator ID
