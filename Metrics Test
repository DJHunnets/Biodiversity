🌿 1. Habitat Heterogeneity Enhancement → Ecosystem Structure Index (ESI)

BI-GDP Integration: Track structural complexity through remote sensing and in-situ data—number of habitat types per hectare, canopy layering, water body density, and edge-to-core ratios. Assign economic value based on increased resilience to climate impacts, carbon sequestration potential, and ecosystem service diversity.

Valuation Mechanism: Green infrastructure savings, insurance value of flood buffering, and biodiversity insurance credits.
🌾 2. Mixed-Species and Indigenous Planting → Agroecological Yield Diversification Metric (AYDM)

BI-GDP Integration: Quantify productivity of mixed cropping systems in biomass yield, pollinator diversity index, and input efficiency. Valuate ecosystem services from agroecological methods—reduced fertilizer use, enhanced pest control, and pollination.

Valuation Mechanism: Productivity per hectare (including service yields), long-term soil fertility index, and risk reduction coefficients.
🐝 3. Species Reintroduction and Corridors → Functional Connectivity Score (FCS)

BI-GDP Integration: Measure functional habitat connectivity via GIS-based corridor mapping, species range recovery, and trophic cascade impacts. Link to economic gains in eco-tourism, ecosystem restoration credits, and water regulation.

Valuation Mechanism: Increased ecosystem service stability, eco-tourism inflows, biodiversity offsets in permitting markets.
🔬 4. Microbiome and Soil Restoration → Soil Biological Health Index (SBHI)

BI-GDP Integration: Include microbial richness, enzyme activity, and organic carbon content as indicators of ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration capacity. Factor reduced agrochemical dependency and drought resilience.

Valuation Mechanism: Soil carbon market pricing, avoided cost of soil erosion and nutrient loss, water retention benefits.
🤝 5. Co-stewardship with Indigenous Knowledge → Traditional Ecological Knowledge Index (TEKI)

BI-GDP Integration: Recognize TEK-based land practices by tracking biodiversity maintained in co-managed lands, linguistic diversity, and intergenerational knowledge transfer. Measure cultural services, governance resilience, and sustainable yields.

Valuation Mechanism: Cultural ecosystem service valuation, co-management success indicators, social equity metrics.
